# Camera-parameters-and-F-E-matrix
An assignment from Aalto University. To solve the camera parameters and obtain Essential matrix and Fundmental Matrix.
Put all the files in the same folder, then open"normalize_image_observations". 
After pressing space button, we can start matching points.
We need 8-points(8-point method).
Afterwards, when we click the image, it will automatically show uo a green line, which is the epipolar line.
Then the intersection of the lines is epipolar points.
